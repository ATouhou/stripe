### Coupons

A coupon contains information about a percent-off discount you might want to apply to a customer. Coupons only apply to invoices created for recurring subscriptions and invoice items; they do not apply to one-off charges.

#### Create a new coupon

You can create coupons easily via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.

A coupon has either a `percent_off` or an `amount_off` and `currency`. If you set an `amount_off`, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice's subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of $10 will have a final total of $0 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 2000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of $30 will have a final total of $10 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 2000 is applied to it.

	'duration'    => 'forever',
	'percent_off' => 50,
]);

echo $coupon['id'];
```

#### Delete a coupon

You can delete coupons via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. However, deleting a coupon does not affect any customers who have already applied the coupon; it means that new customers can't redeem the coupon. You can also delete coupons via the API.

--- | -------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------
id  | true     | string | null    | The coupon unique identifier.

```php
$coupon = Stripe::coupons()->destroy([
	'id' => '50-PERCENT-OFF',
]);
```
