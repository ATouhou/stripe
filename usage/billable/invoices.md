### Invoices

#### Creating Invoices

Creating invoices on your billable entities is a breeze.

###### Create the invoices item and Create the Invoice

First we need to create an invoice item:

```php
$item = $user->invoice()->items()->create([
	'amount'      => 34.50,
	'currency'    => 'USD',
	'description' => 'Line 1 description',
]);
```

Now that we have our item created we can create our invoice:

```php
$invoice = $user->invoice()->create();
```

###### Create a new Invoice and pass in invoice line items

```php
$invoice = $user->invoice()->create([
	'items' => [
		[
			'amount'      => 34.50,
			'currency'    => 'USD',
			'description' => 'Line 1 description',
		],
		[
			'amount'      => 10.95,
			'currency'    => 'USD',
			'description' => 'Line 2 description',
		],
	],
]);
```

#### Pay an Invoice

```php
$user->invoice(10)->pay();
```

or

```php
$user->invoice()->pay('in_4TGCNPyz32qIUr');
```

#### Retrieve all the invoices

```php
$user = User::find(1);

$invoices = $user->invoices;
```

#### Retrieve an existing invoice

```php
$user = User::find(1);

$invoice = $user->invoices->find(10);

$items = $invoice->items;

echo $invoice['total'];
```

> **Note:** The metadata table columns are configurable through the migration, but keep in mind that you might require to extend the invoice metadata model to include your own column names on the `$fillable` property.

#### Sync data from Stripe

Often you might have the need to sync the data from Stripe with your database, we have an easy way to achieve this.

```php
$user = User::find(1);

$user
	->invoice()
	->syncWithStripe();
```

> **Note:** You can pass a invoice id `integer` or a `Cartalyst\Stripe\Billing\Models\IlluminateInvoice` object through the `invoice()` method.
